"""Keep the data directory in the database when the database is remote.

On Vercel only ``/tmp`` is writable and it dies with the instance, yet the
Garmin tokens, the coach's memory, the dictation misses and the daily sync
marker must outlive it. Code keeps writing plain files under
``config.data_dir``; this module copies them into ``app.files`` after each
request and back onto disk the first time an instance serves one.

An instance only writes back the files it changed itself (compared with what
it last read or wrote), so two instances do not overwrite each other's work
with stale copies. Only the paths listed below are mirrored: anything else in
the data directory (FIT files, a local database file, plans) is neither read
nor hashed, and foreign rows already in ``app.files`` stay on the server.

"""Turning workout text into a saved session, for the route and the agent alike.

This used to live inside ``POST /strength/sessions/parse``. The coaching agent
needs the same behaviour — the athlete's abbreviations, the catalog matching,
the planned session completed on save — and a second copy would have drifted
from the first within a month.

One thing changes in the move: an exercise the catalog could not match was
silently skipped on the way in, leaving no trace of what was lost. It is
reported now. That was tolerable when a human was looking at the form; it is
not when an agent is dictating and the athlete only reads a sentence.

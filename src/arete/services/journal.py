"""The coach's journal, handed to the model instead of fetched by it.

The prompts used to say "read the journal before advising", and the agent did
— `ls`, `read_file` on `notes.md`, `read_file` on `sessions.md` — before it
looked at anything else. Every one of those is a round trip, so a single
question cost two or three model requests before the real work started. On
the OpenRouter free tier, at 50 requests a day, requests are the scarce
resource, not tokens.

So the journal now arrives with the system prompt. deepagents'
`MemoryMiddleware` does exactly this and was not used, for two reasons:

- **It has no bound.** It injects files whole, on every model call. Rotation
  lets `sessions.md` reach 40k characters, about 10k tokens — more than the
  whole fixed cost of a call, on every call.
- **Its preamble is written for a coding agent**, about 1k tokens of
  guidelines on Slack IDs, Google accounts and LangChain examples, also paid
  on every call.

What is injected here is bounded: `notes.md`, the durable facts, up to a
budget; and only the most recent entries of `sessions.md`, cut on entry
headings so no entry is half-shown. Anything further back — older entries,
the monthly archives — is still one `read_file` away, and the block says so.

Read from disk on each model call rather than once per turn: two small files,
and an entry the agent writes mid-turn shows up in its next call instead of
contradicting what it just did. The block goes at the end of the system
prompt so the stable part before it keeps the same prefix from call to call.

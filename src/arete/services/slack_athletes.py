"""Which athlete a Slack author is, and that athlete's Slack preferences.

Identity follows sign-in: a Slack profile email resolves to an athlete only
through a verified Arete login (or the operator's owner addresses), never
through a Slack-side claim alone. ``app.users`` and ``app.slack_athletes`` are
global tables keyed by athlete, read before any scope exists; every write here
is limited to the trusted current athlete.

"""Post-session feedback, written by the coach and filed in its journal.

Replaces the one-shot "reformulate this sentence" call that used to sit
behind ``POST /tips/post-session``. Two things change for the athlete:

- the feedback is written by the agent that can read the rest of their
  training, instead of a model that only saw a pre-rendered sentence;
- the session lands in ``sessions.md``, so tomorrow's briefing — and the next
  conversation in the side panel — already know it happened.

Same contract as the briefing: the rule-based text is the floor, computed by
the caller and handed in. A failure here returns that floor, never an error.

The daily sync imports several sessions at once: ``batch_session_feedback``
answers them all with one model request, one numbered section per session.

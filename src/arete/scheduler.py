"""Daily background sync (Garmin activities + health, Strava) inside the API.

Enabled by ``ARETE_AUTO_SYNC_HOUR`` (local hour). No extra dependency: an
asyncio task wakes up every few minutes, compares the wall clock to the
scheduled hour and runs the blocking syncs in a worker thread when the day's
run is still owed. Short ticks on purpose: a laptop that sleeps freezes the
container's monotonic clock, and a single long sleep would silently skip a day.
The last run is written next to the database, so a restart does not re-run a
sync that already happened — and does run the one that was missed.
Failures are logged and never stop the loop.
